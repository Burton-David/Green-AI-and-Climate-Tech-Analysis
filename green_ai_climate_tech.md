# Green AI and Climate Tech: How Data Scientists Can Drive Sustainability Initiatives

## Introduction

In an era where artificial intelligence is revolutionizing industries across the board, a critical question emerges: How can we harness the power of AI while minimizing its environmental impact? This article explores the intersection of data science and sustainability, highlighting how data scientists can contribute to climate tech solutions while being mindful of their own environmental footprint.

## The Environmental Impact of AI

### Understanding AI's Carbon Footprint

Modern AI models, particularly large language models and deep learning systems, require significant computational resources. Our analysis reveals the relationship between model size, power consumption, and carbon emissions:

Key findings from our analysis:
- Small models (<100M parameters) typically consume around 100 kWh during training
- Very large models can consume up to 100,000 kWh, equivalent to the annual energy usage of several households
- Training time has a direct correlation with carbon emissions
- Efficiency ratios vary significantly across model sizes
